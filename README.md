# Parallel Computing

Implementation of some common Parallel Computing Algorithms using the libraries MPI and OpenMP:
- Sum of *N* numbers on MIMD-DM using three strategies;
- Product *matrix × vector* on MIMD-SM;
- Product *matrix × matrix* on MIMD-DM using BMR (**Broadcast Multiply Rolling**) strategy.
